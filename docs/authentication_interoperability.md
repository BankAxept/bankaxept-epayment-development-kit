## Authentication Provider setup and guidelines
Every Integrator is required to provide an Authentication Provider that will be used to verify the authenticity of the payment request. This is done by
providing an encrypted data object in any enrollment/payment request that contains data generated by the Authentication Provider.


### Authentication Provider requirements
In order to facilitate an authenticated payment the Authentication Provider must provide a signed JWS token that is verified by EPP.
This JWS needs to contain a `PermissionGrant` object that is encoded in the JWS token. It must have
the structure as seen in the [components overiew](assets/swagger/swagger_epp_components.md).

We recommend using a robust signing algorithm such as `RS256`.

The `Digest` field in the `PermissionGrant` object is a `Base64` encoded SHA-256 hash of the following datapoints.

For enrollment:
````
nonce: Must be the same as the corresponding nonce in the PermissionGrant object.
accountNumber: The Account Number of the enrollment session. 
tokenRequestorName: The Token Requestor Name.
````

For payment:

````
nonce: Must be the same as the corresponding nonce in the PermissionGrant object.
merchantReference: Set by Wallet.
merchantDisplayName: Set by Wallet.
amount: Set by Wallet.
currency: Set by Wallet.
````

### Wallet requirements
Any request must contain `encryptedCardholderAuthenticationData` which matches the `verifiedCardholderAuthenticationSignedData` object once decrypted.

The `verifiedCardholderAuthenticationSignedData` object must be encrypted using the provided public certificate from EPP as received in point 7 in [Setting up your EPP integration](getting/started/#setting-up-your-epp-integration).
The `verifiedCardholderAuthenticationSignedData` object can be reviewed in our [components overiew](assets/swagger/swagger_epp_components.md).

The `ISS` field is received from EPP and acts as a correlation to the Authentication provider that was configured to your Profile.

A corresponding `Token Requestor Name` that represent the human-readable name of the token requestor will also be provided.
This needs to be encoded in the Authentication Provider's `PermissionGrant` object.

## Illustrated EPP-Wallet-Authentication Provider interoperability

First a `PermissionGrant` object is created. It's structure can be reviewed in the [components overiew](assets/swagger/swagger_epp_components.md).
This object is then encoded in a signed JWS token that is signed using the private key of the Authentication Provider. The signature is then validated in EPP.

Enrollment used as example, same fundamental structure applies for payment.
```mermaid
erDiagram
    PermissionGrant ||--|| Digest : "Base64-encoded SHA-256 hash"
    PermissionGrant {
        string type
        int iat
        string iss
        string nonce
        string sub
        string permissionId
        string Digest    
        }
    Digest {
      string nonce
      string acountNumber
      string tokenRequestorName
    }

```

This is then encoded in a JWS token that is signed by the Authentication Provider's private key. The JWS token is then sent to EPP for validation as part of the Integrator's Payment/Enrollment request.



Enrollment used as example, same fundamental structure applies for payment.
```mermaid
erDiagram
  EnrolmentCardholderAuthenticationData ||--|| verifiedCardholderAuthenticationSignedData : "JWS token signed by Authentication Provider"
  EnrolmentCardholderAuthenticationData {
        object EnrollmentData
        string iss
        integer iat
        string verifiedCardholderAuthenticationSignedData
    }
    verifiedCardholderAuthenticationSignedData {
      object PermissionGrant
    }

```

This data object must then be encrypted using the public certificate provided by EPP.
This is then made a part of every enrollment/payment request towards EPP in the `encryptedCardholderAuthenticationData`.

This leads to the following sequence.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Integrator
    participant AuthenticationProvider
    participant ePaymentPlatform
    
    Integrator ->> AuthenticationProvider: Request JWS token. Providing Digest input.
    note right of AuthenticationProvider: Note that the required Digest input is different <br/>in enrollment and payment requests.
    AuthenticationProvider ->> AuthenticationProvider: Create Digest encrypted hash.
    AuthenticationProvider ->> AuthenticationProvider: Create PermissionGrant object.
    AuthenticationProvider ->> AuthenticationProvider: Create and Sign JWS token. Using AuthenticationProvider private key.
    AuthenticationProvider ->> Integrator: Return JWS token.
    Integrator ->> Integrator : Encrypt required data resulting in corresponding encryptedCardholderAuthenticationData.
    note left of Integrator: Note that the required <br/>encryptedCardholderAuthenticationData <br/> input is different in enrollment<br/> and payment requests. <br/> Encrypt using EPP public key.

    Integrator ->> ePaymentPlatform: Enrollment/Payment Request.
    ePaymentPlatform ->> ePaymentPlatform: Verify request
    note right of ePaymentPlatform: Verify IAT timestamp, ISS Matching, <br/> AuthenticationProvider signature and Digest match.

```

The combined data structure for a request can also be considered as seen below. Enrollment used as example, same fundamental structure applies for payment. 
The green color indicates Integrator, while the blue color indicates Authentication provider.
